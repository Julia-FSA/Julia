- Search for recipes for a single item provided to Sous
- Save recipes that you enjoyed or want to cook in the future that will persist in our database
- Remove items from your fridge (and our database)
- Remove saved recipes that will persist per user

## The accompanied Web Application will allow you to:

- Save recipes for single items from your fridge
- Remove items from your fridge
- View recipes that can be made with some of or all of your fridge items
